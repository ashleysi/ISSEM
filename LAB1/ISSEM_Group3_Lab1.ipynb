    "### QUESTION 11\n",
    "Basic cybersecurity questions:\n",
    "Please explain the following terms:\n",
    "- Cryptography\n",
    "- Encryption\n",
    "- Plain Text\n",
    "- Cipher Text\n",
    "- Decryption\n",
    "- Double Strength Encryption\n",
    "- Hybrid Encryption \n",
    "    \n",
    "### Cryptography\n",
    "Cryptography has been around for centuries. One of the earliest examples of its use was for \"The Babington Plot.\" Cryptography is the science and art of designing secure communication systems. It enables the transmission of information such a way that onlt the intended recipeint(s) can understand and read the messafe. Outsiders should not be able to understand the content. This field encompasses techniques such as encryption, decryption, and digital signatures.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Encryption\n",
    "Encryption is the process of converting plaintext or any other type of understandable data into a coded version (ciphertext) that can only be decoded and understood by someone who has the encryption key.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Plain Text\n",
    "Plain Text refers to the original, human readable information or data that needs to be encrypted. It's the input for the encryption process and the output for the decryption process. For example, a plain text message is what you are reading now. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Cipher Text\n",
    "Cipher Text is the encoded or transformed version of the plaintext after the encryption process. It appears as a random sequence of characters and is not understandable without the decryption key. This message is unreadable by humans and must be decrypted to be brought back to its plain text state. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Decryption\n",
    "Decryption reveals the message or data. It is the reverse process of encryption by converting the ciphertext back to its original form (plaintext) using a specific decryption key.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Double Strength Encryption\n",
    "Double Strength Encryption typically refers to the use of two encryption algorithms or the same algorithm with two independent keys, one after the other, to enhance security. If one encryption method is compromised, the data is still protected by the second layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hybrid Encryption\n",
    "Hybrid Encryption combines the strengths of both symmetric (e.g., AES) and asymmetric (e.g., RSA) encryption. Generally, the data is encrypted using a symmetric key, while the symmetric key itself is encrypted using an asymmetric key pair. This combination provides the efficiency of symmetric encryption with the security benefits of asymmetric encryption.\n"

    "\n",
    "### Shift Ciphers\n",
    "If you have a message you want to transmit securely, you can encrypt it (translate it into a secret code). One of the simplest ways to do this is with a shift cipher. Famously, Julius Caesar used this type of cipher when sending messages to his military commanders.\n",
    "\n",
    "We’ll call this number the encryption key. It is just the length of the shift we are using. For example, upon encrypting the message “cookie” using a shift cipher with encryption key 3, we obtain the encoded message (or ciphertext): FRRNLH.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s consider the following conversion table for English alphabets:\n",
    "1) Using the table, we can represent the letters in our message “cookie” with their corresponding numbers: 2 14 14 10 8 4.\n",
    "2) Now add 3 (the encryption key) to each number to get: 5 17 17 13 11 7\n",
    "3) Now use the table to replace these numbers with their corresponding letters: FRRNLH\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let’s try doing the same thing for the word “zero”. What letter would we use to replace the letter “z” when we encrypt? We use the letter “c”, which can be viewed as being 3 places further along than “z” if, after we reach “z”, we cycle the alphabet around to the beginning again.\n",
    "\n",
    "After performing shift cipher encryption key 3, the message “zero” becomes CHUR. In terms of mathematical representation of our letters, the encryption of the message “zero” looks this way, \n",
    "\n",
    "- 25 4 17 14 → 28 7 20 17\n",
    "\n",
    "What have we done mathematically? There is a handy mathematical concept that describes this very nicely. Define the following notation for integers a and b and integer m > 1:\n",
    "\n",
    "- a ≡ b (mod m) means m is a divisor of a − b.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, our encryption of the message “zero” using a shift cipher with encryption key 3 looks like this\n",
    "\n",
    "- z → 25 → 25 + 3 ≡ 28 (mod 26) → C\n",
    "- e → 4 → 4 + 3 ≡ 7 (mod 26) → H\n",
    "- r → 17 → 17 + 3 ≡ 20 (mod 26) → U\n",
    "- o → 14 → 14 + 3 ≡ 17 (mod 26) → R\n",
    "\n",
    "How is the original (plaintext) message recovered from the ciphertext if the encryption key is known?\n",
    "\n",
    "The following ciphertext was produced using a shift cipher with encryption key 3: CHUR.\n",
    "\n",
    "To decrypt it (i.e., to recover the plaintext message), we need to subtract 3 ( . . . or add 23 . . . why is that the same?) to each of the numbers representing the ciphertext letters.\n",
    "\n",
    "- C → 2 → 2 - 3 ≡ -1 (mod 26) → Z\n",
    "- H → 7 → 7 - 3 ≡ 4 (mod 26) → E\n",

    "What is hash function in cryptography?\n",
    "\n",
    "In cryptography, a hash function is a deterministic algorithm that takes an input (or 'message') and produces a fixed-size string of bytes. The output, typically a digest, is unique (to a high probability) for every distinct input. It is computationally difficult to regenerate the original input value given the hash output. This property, known as pre-image resistance, ensures that a hash function is suitable for data integrity checks, digital signatures, and other cryptographic applications.\n"
