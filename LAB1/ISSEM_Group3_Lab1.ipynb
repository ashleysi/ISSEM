    "### QUESTION 11\n",
    "Basic cybersecurity questions:\n",
    "Please explain the following terms:\n",
    "- Cryptography\n",
    "- Encryption\n",
    "- Plain Text\n",
    "- Cipher Text\n",
    "- Decryption\n",
    "- Double Strength Encryption\n",
    "- Hybrid Encryption \n",
    "    \n",
    "### Cryptography\n",
    "Cryptography has been around for centuries. One of the earliest examples of its use was for \"The Babington Plot.\" Cryptography is the science and art of designing secure communication systems. It enables the transmission of information such a way that onlt the intended recipeint(s) can understand and read the messafe. Outsiders should not be able to understand the content. This field encompasses techniques such as encryption, decryption, and digital signatures.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Encryption\n",
    "Encryption is the process of converting plaintext or any other type of understandable data into a coded version (ciphertext) that can only be decoded and understood by someone who has the encryption key.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Plain Text\n",
    "Plain Text refers to the original, human readable information or data that needs to be encrypted. It's the input for the encryption process and the output for the decryption process. For example, a plain text message is what you are reading now. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Cipher Text\n",
    "Cipher Text is the encoded or transformed version of the plaintext after the encryption process. It appears as a random sequence of characters and is not understandable without the decryption key. This message is unreadable by humans and must be decrypted to be brought back to its plain text state. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Decryption\n",
    "Decryption reveals the message or data. It is the reverse process of encryption by converting the ciphertext back to its original form (plaintext) using a specific decryption key.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Double Strength Encryption\n",
    "Double Strength Encryption typically refers to the use of two encryption algorithms or the same algorithm with two independent keys, one after the other, to enhance security. If one encryption method is compromised, the data is still protected by the second layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hybrid Encryption\n",
    "Hybrid Encryption combines the strengths of both symmetric (e.g., AES) and asymmetric (e.g., RSA) encryption. Generally, the data is encrypted using a symmetric key, while the symmetric key itself is encrypted using an asymmetric key pair. This combination provides the efficiency of symmetric encryption with the security benefits of asymmetric encryption.\n"
